      "spam (stylized as spam) is a brand of canned precooked and preseasoned pork made by hormel foods corporation. it was introduced by hormel in 1937 and gained popularity worldwide after its use during world war ii.&#91;1&#93; by 2003, spam was sold in 41 countries (and trademarked in over 100) on six continents .&#91;2&#93; in the u.s., hawaii is the state with the highest per capita consumption of spam, which has become an ingredient in hawaiian cuisine (like sushi). the generic form of spam may be sold in cans as \"pork luncheon meat\". \n",
      "spam's basic ingredients are primarily pork shoulder and ham,&#91;3&#93; with salt, water, modified potato starch (as a binder), sugar, and sodium nitrite (as a preservative). natural gelatin is formed during cooking in its tins on the production line.&#91;4&#93; concerns about spam's nutritional attributes have been raised, in large part due to its high content of fat, sodium, and preservatives.&#91;5&#93;spam has affected popular culture, including a monty python skit, which repeated the name many times, leading to its name being borrowed to describe unsolicited electronic messages, especially email.&#91;6&#93;  it is occasionally celebrated in festivals such as austin's spamarama.\hormel introduced spam on july 5, 1937.&#91;7&#93;the oxford encyclopedia of food and drink in america states that the product was intended to increase the sale of pork shoulder, a cut which did not sell well the difficulty of delivering fresh meat to the front during world war ii saw spam become a ubiquitous part of the u.s. soldier's diet. it became variously referred to as \"ham that didn't pass its physical,\" \"meatloaf without basic training,and \"special army meat.\" over 68,000 tonnes (150&#160;million pounds) of spam were purchased by the military before the war's end.during world war ii and the occupations that followed, spam was introduced into guam, hawaii, okinawa, the philippines, and other islands in the pacific. immediately absorbed into native diets, it has become a unique part of the history and effects of u.s. influence in the pacific islands.as a consequence of world war ii rationing and the lend-lease act, spam was sold in the united kingdom. british prime minister margaret thatcher later referred to it as a \"wartime delicacy in addition to increasing production for the u.k., hormel expanded spam output as part of allied aid to the soviet union. in his memoir khrushchev remembers, nikita khrushchev declared: \"without spam, we wouldn't have been able to feed our army throughout the war, countries ravaged by the conflict and faced with strict food rations came to appreciate spam the billionth can of spam was sold in 1959,&#91;18&#93; the seven billionth can was sold in 2007,&#91;7&#93; and the eight billionth can was sold in domestically, spam's chief advantages were affordability, accessibility, and extended shelf life statistics from the 1990s say that 3.8 cans of spam were consumed every second in the united states totaling nearly 122 million cans annually. it became part of the diet of almost 30% of american households, perceived differently in various regions of the country.&#91;21&#93; it is also sometimes associated with economic hardship because of its relatively low cost. spam that is sold in north america, south america, and australia is produced in austin, minnesota (also known as \"spam town usa\") and in dubuque, iowa.&#91;22&#93; austin, minnesota also had a restaurant with a menu devoted exclusively to spam called \"johnny's spamarama menu.\"&#91;23&#93;residents of the state of hawaii have the highest per capita consumption in the united states, bringing in sales of 7 million cans of spam per year. its perception there is very different from on the mainland.&#91;25&#93 hawaiians sometimes call it \"portagee steak\".&#91;26&#93,a local dish in hawaii is spam musubi, where cooked spam is placed atop rice and wrapped in a band of nori, a form of nigiri.&#91;27&#93; varieties of spam are found in hawaii and saipan that are unavailable in other markets, including honey spam, spam with bacon, and hot and spicy spam.&#91;28&#93;hawaiian buger king restaurants began serving spam in 2007 to compete with the local mcdonald's chains (which also serve spam).&#91;12&#93;&#91;29&#93; in hawaii, spam is so popular that it is sometimes referred to as \"the hawaiian steak\".&#91;30&#93; there is even an annual spam-themed festival on the island of oahu that takes place every spring, known as the \"waikiki spam jam\".&#91;31&#93; local chefs and restaurants compete to create new spam-themed dishes, which are then sold in a massive street fair on kalakaua avenue in waikiki.\nin 2017, hawaii was plagued by a rash of thefts of spam.&#91;32&#93; spam had long been a target of thieves in hawaii, but the magnitude of the thefts ramped up, with incidents in which multiple cases of spam were stolen at once. local retailers believe organized crime was involved.&#91;32&#93; this came alongside increases in thefts of some other retail goods, such as corned beef and liquor. the president of the retail merchants of hawaii attributed the rise in retail thefts to a recent change in criminal law, which raised the threshold at which a theft would lead to felony charges by approximately $400.&#91;32&#93;"
